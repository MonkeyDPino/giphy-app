# Giphy Pino
React App that provides gifs using the api service provided by [GIPHY](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide).

### Reason

This is just an app to practice react skills, i used vercel to host it [here](https://giphy-pino.vercel.app), and the backend is hosted in heroku using MongoDB Atlas as database.
